**William Shakespeare**  ( 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world’s pre-eminent dramatist.

**_Hamlet_** is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare between 1599 and 1601. It outlines the Prince of Denmark’s struggle to avenge his father’s murder, highlighting his difficulty pursuing his sense of duty and honor in the face of not just practical difficulties but also his sense of the inconsistencies and uncertainties in the political, religious, and cultural world that make his goal of taking revenge potentially immoral or even pointless. The play is arguably the most famous revenge tragedy ever written.

## Summary

One night at the Danish castle of Elsinore, a soldier named Barnardo relieves Francisco—a fellow soldier—from his watch duties. Another soldier, Marcellus, and a nobleman named Horatio also arrive, and the group talks about rumors of a ghost. Horatio is skeptical, but then the ghost appears wearing the clothes of the late King Hamlet. The ghost says nothing, but Horatio is sure its appearance is ominous. Because the ghost won’t speak to him, Horatio decides to fetch Prince Hamlet.

Claudius—the late King Hamlet’s brother—holds court, having become king by marrying Gertrude, Prince Hamlet’s mother. He and Gertrude encourage Hamlet to stop mourning his father, insisting that death is natural and that it’s ill-advised to dwell too long on loss. When they exit, Horatio enters and informs Hamlet about the ghost of his father, and Hamlet plans to accompany him to the ramparts that night to see for himself.

Laertes—the son of Claudius’s advisor, Polonius—prepares to leave for France. As he does so, he talks to his sister, Ophelia, about Hamlet, warning her not to get too close to him. Polonius enters and overhears some of this conversation. After Laertes departs, Polonius supports his son’s points about Hamlet, making Ophelia promise to stop spending time with the young prince.

Hamlet goes to the ramparts with Horatio and Marcellus and encounters the ghost. He asks the ghost questions, but instead of answering them, the ghost encourages Hamlet to follow it. Horatio and Marcellus try to prevent Hamlet from going, but Hamlet defies them, insisting that he doesn’t value his life enough to care what happens to him.

Having led Hamlet away from Horatio and Marcellus, the ghost confirms that he is the ghost of King Hamlet. He also tells Hamlet that his death wasn’t an accident—Claudius poisoned him. Having said this, the ghost asks Hamlet to avenge his death. Horatio and Marcellus catch up after the ghost disappears, and Hamlet makes them swear to keep silent about the ghost, adding that he might act strange in the coming days.

In Elsinore, Polonius hatches a plan to spy on Laertes, wanting to know what kind of life his son is leading in France. After he puts this plan in motion, Ophelia enters and tells him that Hamlet burst into her room looking crazy. Assuming Hamlet is angry because Ophelia has spurned his advances, Polonius worries that he misled his daughter by telling her to avoid the prince.

Claudius receives news that Fortinbras, the aggressive Prince of Norway, has been convinced to invade Poland instead of Denmark, though he wants permission to pass through Denmark on the way to war. Meanwhile, Hamlet’s old friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive to cheer him up, bringing with them a troupe of actors. Seeing an opportunity, Hamlet decides to have the actors stage a reenactment of his father’s murder so that he can gauge Claudius’s reaction.

To gauge Hamlet’s mental state, Claudius and Polonius hide while Ophelia engages him in conversation. In this exchange, Hamlet goes back and forth about whether he ever truly loved Ophelia, confounding her and ranting about how she should flee to a convent because women like her tempt men into wickedness. Feeling that Hamlet is truly unwell, Claudius plans to send him to England so he won’t wreak havoc in Denmark.

In a private conversation, Hamlet tells Horatio to watch Claudius during the play. If Claudius responds calmly to the theatrical depiction of King Hamlet’s murder, then perhaps he’s truly innocent. However, when the scene takes place, Claudius jumps up and storms away. Hamlet is certain this means Claudius is guilty. Meanwhile, Gertrude is deeply upset by Hamlet’s insensitivity, and Hamlet worries that he has been too cruel to his mother.

Catching wind that Hamlet is on his way to Gertrude’s chamber, Polonius plans to hide and eavesdrop on their conversation. He thus leaves Claudius alone, at which point the king delivers a soliloquy in which he confesses to murdering his brother. He’s remorseful, but not so remorseful that he wants to genuinely atone for his sins. As he prays, Hamlet enters and considers killing him, but he ultimately decides to wait until Claudius sins again.

Hamlet enters Gertrude’s room and has strong words for her. Gertrude becomes frightened and cries for help, and Polonius yells from his hiding place behind a tapestry. Startled, Hamlet stabs him, and then the ghost appears and urges Hamlet to hurry his quest for revenge. Gertrude thinks her son is crazy but agrees to keep quiet about what has happened. Hamlet says he must sneak away before he’s sent to England, where he suspects Claudius has arranged his execution.

Gertrude tells Claudius that Hamlet is crazy and that he killed Polonius, so Claudius sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to find him and to locate Polonius’s body. Hamlet’s old friends catch up with him, but he refuses to reveal where he put Polonius’s body. He eventually runs off and tells them they’ll have to catch him.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern catch up with Hamlet, but he refuses to reveal where he put Polonius’s body. He eventually runs off and tells them they’ll have to catch him.

Guildenstern and Rosencrantz catch up with Hamlet and bring him to Claudius, who asks where the prince has stashed Polonius’s body. After evading the question, Hamlet suggests that Polonius’s body is somewhere in the hall of the castle. Claudius, for his part, still plans to have Hamlet taken to England, and he privately notes (after Hamlet has been led out of the room) that he has instructed the King of England to execute Hamlet.

Fortinbras arrives at Elsinore with his army and instructs his primary captain to tell Claudius that they are at his service while passing through Denmark on their way to conquer Poland. Hamlet then crosses paths with the captain, and when he realizes that Fortinbras has sent so many soldiers to conquer Poland (which is not viewed as all that valuable), he feels inspired once more to take action against his father’s murderer.

In the aftermath of Polonius’s death, Ophelia has lost her mind with grief. She rants to Gertrude and Claudius about nonsensical matters, frequently referencing flowers. Shortly thereafter, Elsinore is overtaken as Laertes makes a bold entrance and accuses Claudius of killing Polonius, but Claudius insists that he’s innocent, even saying that he’ll gladly stand trial. Once he has cleared his name, Claudius says, he’ll help Laertes take revenge on his father’s true killer.

Two sailors bring Horatio a letter from Hamlet, who has been at sea for two days. The letter informs Horatio that the ship Hamlet was on was overtaken by pirates, who took Hamlet hostage. In his letter, Hamlet tells Horatio to direct the two sailors to Claudius so that they can deliver a second letter to the king.

After convincing Laertes that Hamlet killed Polonius, Claudius receives the prince’s letter, which informs him that Hamlet has returned to Denmark and wants to meet. With this in mind, Claudius and Laertes hatch a plan for Laertes to kill Hamlet in a fencing match using a poisoned rapier. Just then, Gertrude enters and informs them that Ophelia has drowned. Distraught, Laertes leaves to mourn his sister and prepare to kill Hamlet.

Two gravediggers prepare Ophelia’s gravesite. Hamlet and Horatio encounter them and talk about death. As they talk, Laertes, Claudius, and Gertrude appear with a priest and Ophelia’s body. Seeing Laertes mourning Ophelia, Hamlet reveals himself and insists that he’s more upset than Laertes about Ophelia’s death. This leads to a brawl, though their fight is broken up, and Claudius privately tells Laertes to be patient in his desire to take revenge on Hamlet.

Back in Elsinore, Hamlet accepts a challenge to fence Laertes. When the duel begins, he quickly lands several hits. Meanwhile, Gertrude accidentally drinks poisoned wine intended for Hamlet. Laertes hits Hamlet with the poisoned rapier but loses hold of the sword—Hamlet grabs it and cuts Laertes with it. As Laertes dies, he reveals that Claudius masterminded the plot to kill Hamlet, so Hamlet stabs the king. Everyone except Horatio dies, at which point Fortinbras appears and takes the throne.
