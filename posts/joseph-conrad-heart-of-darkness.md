**Heart of Darkness**  (1899) is a novella by Polish-English novelist Joseph Conrad in which the sailor Charles Marlow tells his listeners the story of his assignment as steamer captain for a Belgian company in the African interior. The novel is widely regarded as a critique of European colonial rule in Africa, whilst also examining the themes of power dynamics and morality. Although Conrad does not name the river on which most of the narrative takes place, at the time of writing the Congo Free State, the location of the large and economically important Congo River, was a private colony of Belgium’s King Leopold II. Marlow is given a text by Kurtz, an ivory trader working on a trading station far up the river, who has “gone native” and is the object of Marlow’s expedition.

## Character List

1.  [**Charlie Marlow**](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/character-analysis/marlow): a 32 year-old man who has “followed the sea.” Marlow’s story of his voyage up the Congo River constitutes almost all of [Conrad](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/joseph-conrad-biography)‘s novel. He pilots the steamboat sent to relieve Kurtz and is shocked by what he sees the European traders have done to the natives.
2.  [**Kurtz**](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/character-analysis/kurtz) an ivory trader for the Company. Kurtz works out of the Inner Station and is remarkably effective at acquiring ivory. A well-educated European, he is described as a “universal genius” and begins his work in the Congo as part of a virtuous mission. However, while in the jungle, he sets himself up as a god to the natives. By the time Marlow reaches him, he is emaciated and dying.
3.  [**The Manager**](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/character-analysis/the-manager) Working out of the Central Station, the Manager oversees the Company’s activities in the Congo. (He is based on a real person, Camille Delcommune.) The Manager is able to inspire uneasiness in others; Marlow later figures out that he was responsible for the wreck of his steamboat. The Manager fears that Kurtz is trying to steal his job.
4.  [**The Accountant**](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/character-analysis/the-accountant) Also working out of the Central Station, the Accountant somehow manages to wear spotless clothes in the sweltering heat and complains about the groans of a dying man who is brought to his office for fear of being distracted and making clerical errors in the Company’s books. He also confides to Marlow some of the Company’s shady business practices.
5.  **The Brickmaker** Although his name suggests the nature of his position, the Brickmaker does not make any bricks because of a shortage of materials. When Marlow meets the Brickmaker at the Central Station, Marlow suspects that he is “pumping” him for information about the Company’s plans.
6.  [**The Harlequin**](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/character-analysis/the-harlequin) a Russian freelance trader who meets Kurtz in the jungle. He admires Kurtz immensely, telling Marlow, “This man has enlarged my mind.”
7.  [**Kurtz’s Native Mistress**](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/character-analysis/kurtzs-native-mistress) Kurtz’s native mistress. She is very protective of Kurtz and leads a chant on the bank of the river when Kurtz leaves the Inner Station. She dresses in bright colors.
8.  **The “Pilgrims”** European agents at the Central Station waiting for a chance to be promoted to trading posts, so they can then earn percentages of the ivory they ship back.
9.  **The Helmsman** a native crewman on Marlow’s steamboat. He is killed by a spear during an attack on the boat.
10.  **The Doctor** When in Brussels, Marlow is examined by the Doctor at the Company’s headquarters. He is interested in the effects of the jungle (and the lack of restraint it offers its inhabitants) on European minds.
11.  **Marlow’s Aunt** Using her influence with the wife of a high Company official, she helps Marlow get his post as a steamboat pilot for the Company.
12.  [**Kurtz’s Intended**](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/character-analysis/the-intended) a demure and mourning young woman; Marlow visits her after he returns to Europe and lies to her about her fiancée’s last words. She is dressed in black.
13.  **The Narrator** an unnamed man on board the Nellie who relates Marlow’s story to the reader.

## Summary

Heart of Darkness begins on the deck of the Nellie, a British ship anchored on the coast of the Thames. The anonymous narrator, the Director of Companies, the [Accountant](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/character-analysis/the-accountant), and [Marlow](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/character-analysis/marlow) sit in silence. Marlow begins telling the three men about a time he journeyed in a steamboat up the Congo River. For the rest of the novel (with only minor interruptions), Marlow narrates his tale.

As a young man, Marlow desires to visit Africa and pilot a steamboat on the Congo River. After learning of the Company — a large ivory-trading firm working out of the Congo — Marlow applies for and receives a post. He leaves Europe in a French steamer.

At the Company’s Outer Station in the Congo, Marlow witnesses scenes of brutality, chaos, and waste. Marlow speaks with an Accountant, whose spotless dress and uptight demeanor fascinate him. Marlow first learns from the Accountant of Kurtz — a “remarkable” agent working in the interior. Marlow leaves the Outer Station on a 200-mile trek across Africa, and eventually reaches the Company’s Central Station, where he learns that the steamboat he is supposed to pilot up the Congo was wrecked at the bottom of the river. Frustrated, Marlow learns that he has to wait at the Central Station until his boat is repaired.

Marlow then meets the Company’s [Manager](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/character-analysis/the-manager), who told him more about [Kurtz](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/heart-of-darkness/character-analysis/kurtz). According to the Manager, Kurtz is supposedly ill, and the Manager feigns great concern over Kurtz’s health — although Marlow later suspects that the Manager wrecked his steamboat on purpose to keep supplies from getting to Kurtz. Marlow also meets the Brickmaker, a man whose position seems unnecessary, because he doesn’t have all the materials for making bricks. After three weeks, a band of traders called The Eldorado Exploring Expedition — led by the Manager’s uncle — arrives.

One night, as Marlow is lying on the deck of his salvaged steamboat, he overhears the Manager and his uncle talk about Kurtz. Marlow concludes that the Manager fears that Kurtz is trying to steal his job. His uncle, however, told him to have faith in the power of the jungle to “do away” with Kurtz.

Marlow’s boat is finally repaired, and he leaves the Central Station (accompanied by the Manager, some agents, and a crew of cannibals) to bring relief to Kurtz. Approximately fifty miles below Kurtz’s Inner Station, they find a hut of reeds, a woodpile and an English book titled An Inquiry into some Points of Seamanship.

As it crept toward Kurtz, Marlow’s steamboat is attacked by a shower of arrows. The Whites fire rifles into the jungle while Marlow tries to navigate the boat. A native helmsman is killed by a large spear and thrown overboard. Assuming that the same natives who are attacking them have already attacked the Inner Station, Marlow feels disappointed now that he will never get the chance to speak to Kurtz.
