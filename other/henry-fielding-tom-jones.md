**_Tom Jones, a Foundling_**  is a 1749 novel by Henry Fielding. It is his most famous work and was considered one of the greatest English novels ever written by subsequent authors like W. Somerset Maughan and Samuel Coleridge. It is divided into eighteen books and aims to explore human nature, covering a wide variety of social themes and literary styles.

### Character List

1.  **Tom Jones:**  Tom Jones, a “bastard” raised by the philanthropic Allworthy, is the novel’s eponymous hero and protagonist. Although Tom’s faults (namely, his imprudence and his lack of chastity) prevent him from being a perfect hero, his good heart and generosity make him Fielding’s avatar of Virtue, along with Allworthy. Tom’s handsome face and gallantry win him the love and affection of women throughout the countryside. His dignified, though natural air induces characters to assume that he is a gentleman—which ultimately turns out to be true.
2.  **Sophia Western:**  Sophia Western is Fielding’s beautiful, generous heroine and the daughter of the violent Squire Western. Like Tom, Sophia lavishes gifts on the poor, and she treats people of all classes with such respect that one landlady cannot believe she is a “gentlewoman.” Sophia manages to reconcile her love for Tom, her filial duty to her father, and her hatred for Blifil through her courage and patience. Sophia’s natural courtesy can be contrasted with her Aunt Western’s artificial manners.
3.  **Mr. Allworthy:**  Mr. Allworthy is just what his name implies: all worthy. Allworthy has a reputation throughout England because of his benevolent, altruistic behavior. The moral yardstick of the novel, Allworthy’s only fault (which ironically propels much of the plot) is that—due to his goodness—he cannot perceive the evil in others.
4.  **Master Blifil:**  Blifil is antagonist to Tom Jones and the son of Bridget Allworthy and Captain Blifil. Although he appears at first to be a virtuous character, his hypocrisy soon exposes itself—Blifil pretends to be pious and principled, but greed governs him. The fact that Blifil has few redeeming qualities makes Tom compassion for him at the end of the novel—after the revelation that Blifil kept the secret of Tom’s birth to himself—even more commendable. Blifil’s dearth of natural human appetites—he at first does not desire Sophia—does not distinguish him as a virtuous character, but rather provides a depressing picture of what humanity would be like if devoid of passion.
5.  **Squire Western:**  Squire Western is a caricature of the rough-and-ready, conservative country gentleman. Affectionate at heart, the Squire nevertheless acts with extreme violence towards his daughter Sophia, by constantly incarcerating her, and even verbally and physically abusing her. However, since the Squire is a caricature, Fielding does not intend for us to judge these actions too harshly. Similarly, the Squire’s insistence on Sophia marrying Blifil has less to do with greed than with his stubbornness and adherence to tradition. Squire Western’s speaks in West Country dialect, and peppers his speech with curses.
6.  **Mrs. Western:**  Mrs. Western, the foil of her brother Squire Western, is a caricature of the artificial city lady who always acts out of expediency. Mrs. Western prides herself on being adept at all intellectual pursuits—from politics to philosophy to feminism to amour—yet her ignorance reveals itself on numerous occasions (she thinks that Socrates lectured to students instead of engaging in conversational debate). Mrs. Western’s sole aim in the novel is to improve the Western name by marrying off Sophia to the richest, most prosperous man she can find.
7.  **Partridge:**  Partridge is the teacher whom Allworthy accuses of being Tom’s father. He is a kind of comedic Harlequin character (Fielding even compares him to Harlequin). Although pathetic, bumbling, and cowardly, Partridge remains a loyal servant to Jones and deserves his reward at the end of the novel. Partridge has a passion for speaking in Latin non sequiturs. Although Partridge creates problems for Tom and Sophia by boosting Tom’s reputation and defiling Sophia’s to all and sundry, Tom cannot help forgiving Partridge, who always has the best of intentions.
8.  **Jenny Jones:**  Jenny Jones (Mrs. Waters) is the student of Partridge whom Allworthy banishes for being Tom’s mother—at the end of the novel we learn that Jenny is not Tom’s mother. Jenny reappears as “Mrs. Waters” at Upton, where Tom saves her from a robbery. Although Jenny does not possess the beauty of a Sophia, her very white breasts attract Tom to her. Although she protests to Mr. Allworthy at the end of the novel that she has led a virtuous life, her seduction of Tom in Upton suggests otherwise. She eventually marries Parson Supple, a friend of Western.
9.  **Bridget Allworthy:**  Bridget Allworthy is the mother of Blifil and Tom. An unattractive lady who resents beautiful women, Bridget marries Captain Blifil because he flatters her religious views. Although Bridget’s affection wavers between Blifil and Tom as the boys mature, she becomes devoted to Tom before her death—largely due to his good looks and gallantry.
10.  **Lady Bellaston:**  Lady Bellaston is a London lady, and a relative of Sophia, whose passionate, lusty personality leads her to dabble in intrigues. The stem of her last name “Bella-“, meaning “war” in Latin, points to her malicious nature—she thinks of no one but herself. Lady Bellaston carries out a vengeful battle against Tom and Sophia with the utmost glee.
11.  **Harriet Fitzpatrick:**  Harriet Fitzpatrick is Sophia’s cousin and the wife of Mr. Fitzpatrick. Pretty and charming, she is nevertheless selfish and contrives against Sophia in order to improve her relationship with Squire Western and Mrs. Western.
12.  **Mr. Fitzpatrick:**  Mr. Fitzpatrick is a rash Irishman whom Harriet Fitzpatrick casts in the light of an ogre chasing her across the countryside. Fitzpatrick becomes admirable, however, when he admits to initiating the duel with Tom at the end of the novel.
13.  **Mr. Dowling:**  Mr. Dowling is a shrewd, shifty lawyer who becomes a friend of Blifil. Always operating out of expediency, when Dowling realizes that Blifil will not be able to reward him for his efforts, he defects to Tom and Allworthy’s side.
14.  **Mrs. Miller:**  Mrs. Miller is a faithful friend to Tom and the most caring and concerned of mothers to Nancy and Betty. Feisty and active, Mrs. Miller carries through on her promises and becomes Tom’s biggest advocate to Allworthy. She is trusting and loyal.
15.  **Nightingale:**  Nightingale, although a foppish city gentleman, possesses the laudable traits of loyalty and compassion—although not always in affairs of love. It takes a little time for Tom to convince Nightingale not to abandon Nancy, since Nightingale is caught up in his image in London. To his credit, Nightingale transforms and follows Tom’s principles of Honour—that is, fulfilling verbal commitments.
16.  **Lord Fellamar:**  Lord Fellamar is a suitor of Sophia who, though he has a conscience, easily allows himself to be manipulated by Lady Bellaston.
17.  **Square:**  Square is a philosopher who lives with Allworthy. He justifies his questionable behavior (such as making love to Molly Seagrim) by contorting his philosophical notions. Square, although a foil to Thwackum, is less sinister than the latter. Indeed, Square’s virtuous transformation at the end of the novel allows Allworthy to forgive Tom.
18.  **Thwackum:**  Thwackum is the vicious tutor of Blifil and Tom who constantly beats Tom and praises Blifil. Thwackum, who claims to value Religion above all else, seeks only his own good.
19.  **Molly Seagrim:**  Molly Seagrim is the rugged, unfeminine daughter of Black George who seduces Tom. Feisty and aggressive, Molly enjoys the company of men, and fights fiercely for her rights.
20.  **Black George:**  Black George is the servant who is favored by Tom. Although of dubious moral tincture (Black George steals and lies), Black George’s loyalty to and love of Tom nevertheless emerges.
21.  **Nancy Miller:**  Nancy Miller is the daughter of Mrs. Miller who becomes Nightingale’s wife.
22.  **Narrator:**  The ironic, intrusive narrator can be assumed to be Fielding himself since he reflects on his process of creating Tom Jones.

## Summary

The book opens by explaining Tom Jones’s origins. Squire Allworthy is a kind and noble man who one day comes home to Paradise Hall to find a baby on his bed, abandoned by his parents. He entrusts the child with his sister Bridget while they try to find out where the baby came from. Village gossip points to a woman called Jenny, so Allworthy brings her in for questioning.

Jenny admits to being the child’s mother and to abandoning him, but refuses to say who the father is. Allworthy gives her money to leave the area and start a new life and decides to bring the boy up himself, with Bridget’s help. Allworthy gives him the name Tom Jones. The townspeople assume that he must be the father because of his kindness.

Allworthy is a childless widower with no intention of remarrying, so his estate will be inherited by any children Bridget has. A man called Blifil seduces and marries her and tries to get rid of Tom, as Tom threatens his children’s inheritance. Blifil convinces Allworthy that Tom’s father is the schoolteacher at whose house Jenny worked, but the squire insists on keeping Tom. Blifil dies soon afterward, but not before Bridget has his child.

The story then jumps twelve years forward, with Tom and Blifil as teenagers. They have been raised together and educated by two men called Mr. Thwackum and Mr. Square. Tom is a rowdy boy who is always getting into trouble, and as such is disliked by his teachers. Blifil is well behaved but secretly jealous of Tom.

Tom has an affair with Molly Seagrim, the daughter of his friend, the gamekeeper Black George. Meanwhile, he falls in love with Sophia, the daughter of Allworthy’s neighbor, Squire Western, and she loves him back. However, they cannot be together because Tom is not well-born and Western would never accept him as a suitor.

Allworthy gets sick and almost dies, but he recovers. Instead, news arrives, by a letter to Allworthy that Blifil intercepts, that Bridget has died during a trip. Tom gets drunk celebrating Allworthy’s recovery and goes to meet Molly. Blifil and Thwackum see them together and later gang up on Tom to fight him. Squire Western intervenes on Tom’s behalf.

Meanwhile, Squire Western’s sister Mrs. Western concludes that Sophia is in love with Blifil. She suggests the match to Western, who is delighted, as Blifil is rich and their union would allow Sophia to remain close by. Blifil also likes the idea. When they realize that Sophia does not love him, Western locks her in her room until she changes her mind.

Western realizes it’s Tom who Sophia loves and becomes enraged at him. He goes to Allworthy to expose Tom’s bad behavior, supported by Blifil, who claims that Tom attacked him the night of the fight. Allworthy is disappointed and feels like he has no choice but to kick Tom out. Meanwhile, Sophia manages to escape with the help of her maid and plans to go to London, where she has a relative.

While on the road, Tom meets and befriends a man called Partridge, who is revealed to be the schoolmaster that Allworthy believed was Tom’s father. Partridge denies this, and the two agree to travel together. At one point, Tom saves an older woman called Mrs. Waters from a murderer and beds her in a nearby inn. A man called Mr. Fitzpatrick, looking for his own wife, barges in but leaves after seeing that Mrs. Waters is not Mrs. Fitzpatrick.

The next morning, Partridge mentions that there was a woman looking for Tom the previous night, but that he had said Tom was occupied with Mrs. Waters. Tom realizes this was Sophia and is distraught because she knows about his infidelity. But now that Tom knows Sophia is on her way to London, and he decides to look for her.

Tom’s search for Sophia in London attracts the attention of the relative with whom she is staying, Lady Bellaston. Lady Bellaston takes a liking to Tom and wants to keep him as her lover. He accepts, knowing that she can get him closer to Sophia. Lady Bellaston takes care to keep them separate, but they do meet eventually. Tom begs forgiveness for his transgressions and Sophia grants it, but they still cannot marry.

Lady Bellaston comes home while they are talking and is immediately suspicious. She decides to marry Sophia to Lord Fellamar, and suggests to him that the only way Sophia will agree is if he rapes her. Just as this is about to happen, Squire Western arrives to fetch his daughter and drags her away to his inn, insisting that she will marry Blifil, who is on his way to London.

Mrs. Western chastises her brother for his rough treatment of Sophia. Mrs. Western asks that Sophia stay in her inn instead, guaranteeing that she will see Sophia married. However, Lady Bellaston has conspired with Mrs. Western, who intends to have Sophia marry Lord Fellamar instead, due to his higher social status.

Lady Bellaston decides she wants no one else to get Tom, so she arranges with Lord Fellamar to have him kidnapped by a gang and shipped off on a boat. Meanwhile, Tom runs into Mr. Fitzpatrick again, who once again accuses him of sleeping with his wife and attacks him. In the fight, Tom stabs Mr. Fitzpatrick, and the whole thing is seen by Lord Fellamar’s gang. They take Tom to the authorities and accuse him of murder.

Tom is thrown into prison, but it isn’t long before Mrs. Waters comes to visit him. She says that Mrs. Fitzpatrick has surfaced and clarified that it was her husband who started the fight and that Mr. Fitzpatrick will heal from his wounds. Tom is set to be released. As Mrs. Waters leaves the prison, Partridge comes to visit Tom and is shocked to see her. He recognizes Mrs. Waters as Jenny, his former employee, and tells Tom that he has slept with his own mother.

Tom is disgusted with himself and sees his lewd behavior as the cause of this tragedy. By this time, Allworthy and Blifil have arrived in London to follow Tom’s verdict. Partridge goes to Allworthy to explain the situation, but Mrs. Waters reveals that she wasn’t Tom’s mother after all.

Tom is actually Bridget’s son, and Bridget had conspired with Jenny to hide this since he was born out of wedlock. When Bridget saw that Allworthy was willing to accept Tom as his own even without knowing they were related, she decided to keep quiet about it. She intended to reveal this as she was dying, but Blifil intercepted the letter and kept the secret, scared of the threat to his inheritance.

Upon hearing this, Allworthy disowns Blifil and accepts Tom as his sole heir. Sophia forgives Tom for his indiscretions, and the two marry happily.

_Tom Jones_ has been adapted into multiple films, operas, and TV shows. As a text, it is notable for the meticulous way in which Fielding lays out his plot. Each book in the novel is preceded by a literary essay, in which he discusses the themes that will be explored in that book and exposes his reasoning for the progress of the story. He lays out his attempt to write a new form of text in detail, giving the reader insight into why the action proceeds as it does.
